## Disclaimer: 

The third party organization in this program has rich experience on deployment of implementations on Filecoin not only on Venus but also on Lotus.However the network is at an early stage and there are many times of network upgrades, the voluneteers are not taking responsibility of the performance of SP output and any third party loss from the operating. 

Users should provide storage service under the permission by law. If the SP is not operating legally then the third party can stop the service anytime and the SP shall bear all legal responsibilities. 

Users should not use or represent "Venus Official" to promote their own business.

## Common Questions: 

1. Devops requires users to provide remote access to servers, but will not directly contact fil assets
2. The Venus team will do a preliminary screening of the user's equipment. Very old equipment is not recommended to access the filecoin network. Becuase there will be many cases of punishment of collaterals.
3. At this moment, we only support equipments that are deployed in a data center.
4. An user should provided the list of equipments at once, and the new hardware or parts that do not match the device list during the service process cannot guarantee timely deployment and operation and maintenance.
5. The three-month free service period starts from the signing of the contract by both parties.
